# ðŸ§© Task 1 â€“ C++ Linked List Loop Detection

Welcome to **Task 1** of the **5.2xGit Open Source Contribution Event**!

This repository contains a **C++ implementation of a singly linked list** and uses the **Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm** (also known as the slow and fast pointer technique) to identify whether a loop exists in the list.

This task is a great way to practice debugging, writing clean and modular C++ code, and contributing to open source through improvements and enhancements.
